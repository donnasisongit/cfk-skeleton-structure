##### Our mission is to create opportunities for kids so they can overcome inequity.

Change for Kids creates opportunities for kids in New York City public schools. We provide critical supports, experiences, and access so they can reimagine their possibilities and overcome inequity. We believe opportunities create options. We believe that one can’t dream what one has not seen. We believe creating opportunities for young people allows them to see themselves with different options, through different lenses. And this affords them the tools to reimagine their own possibility and the tools
with which to overcome inequity.


##### The Change For Kids Model
Improving literacy, social-emotional learning, and community engagement is at the core of our model

##### Partner Schools
Have a collaborative school culture with a commitment to success

##### School Managers
Manage a mix of programs, resources and volunteers for maximum effect

##### Programs
Bring a variety of educational, arts, and vocational opportunities for kids to reimagine possibilities and
broaden horizons

##### Supporters
Provide funding and support that help us deliver and expand our impact

##### Volunteers
Inspire our students and enrich our school communities
